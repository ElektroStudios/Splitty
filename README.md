# Splitty


**Splitty** is an application to split the contents of a directory into multiple directorios according to the specified (disc) size.

To put you in situation, imagine that you have a directory with thousand of files inside that in total occupies 10 GB, and you want to burn the contents of that directory into a DVD media, but you feel that is tedious to split and organize those thousands of files into multiple directories of your DVD size. Here is where **Splitty** can come to help you and save your time by automatizing the tedious work of split your files into multiples directories. But you can use it also for other things.

The program supports optional directory compression using WinRAR or 7Zip.
